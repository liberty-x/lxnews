# LX News

Link [here](http://liberty-x.github.io/lxnews/). Based on mobile-first design- don't be scared when it doesn't look great on desktop! 

## Who?

Liberty-X, a project team in the 6th iteration of the Founders & Coders academy. Members: Justen Barget, Rachel Black, Huw Davies and Ruth Uwemedimo.

## What?

LX News will be a simple photo and news feed webpage. We are hosting this on GitHub Pages. We are conducting this project from the 23rd September to the 25th September. 

## Why?

We are experimenting with the use of various API keys and embedding feeds on our results page.
 
### Functionality

Users input search terms in a search bar on the landing page that returns images tagged with these terms from instagram on a page which will link from the search button. 

### Depedancies
* Instagram API
* Guardian API
* QUnit (for testing)

### Wireframes

Landing page layout like so:

### Task Delegation

### Testing

Please go to our test page [here](http://liberty-x.github.io/lxnews/tests/tests) to test the functionality of our page. This doesn't include our styling, but does test some elements of our Javascript file.
